Caesium
=======

Welcome to Caesium for Max OS X!

This project is porting the [Caesium](http://caesium.sourceforge.net/) to Mac OS X.

Caesium can reduce the size of pictures up to 90%, preserving the original visual quality.

Caesium allows you to save a lot of space on your hard drive and quickly upload your pictures on the web (on sites like Facebook, Google+ etc) saving a lot of time. Also webmasters and bloggers for instance need to make sure the images they post on their websites are optimized, to avoid prolonged loading times for their visitors. The software allows you to view instantly the compression results, helping you to decide how much optimization you need. Caesium can set different compression levels to each image, saving a lot of time, ensuring great results!
